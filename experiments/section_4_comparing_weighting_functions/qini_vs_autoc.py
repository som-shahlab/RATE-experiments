"""A script for comparing the statistical power of the Qini and AUTOC.

This script contains code for comparing the Qini and AUTOC on a level
playing field. Because the Qini Coefficient weights do not necessarily
sum to 1 while those of the AUTOC always do, it can be difficult to
compare the power of these two metrics without centering and scaling
the Qini Coefficient weights. We do that here for a class of natural,
simple functions governing the potential outcomes given treatment
and covariates.

    Calculates a centered and scaled version of the Qini (and AUTOC).

    to be 1 while the variance of the weights applied to these same
